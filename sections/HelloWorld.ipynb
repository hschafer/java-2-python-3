Here, this page is made of a bunch of \"cells\" which contain chunks of code or text. A lot of times you will be writing `.py` files that have all your Python code, but these Notebooks are great for developing chunks of code that you can refer back to later. \n",

You can run a Python cell by pressing the run button after clicking on it (or hitting Shift-Enter if you are editing it). Feel free to edit any of the code examples to try it out yourself!"

You can just write the code you want in the cell like it is wrapped in a main method like you can see in the example below.\n"
